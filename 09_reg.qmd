Let's consider a (fictional) dataset with only five cases. We can create a dataset using the `data.frame` command. Our dataset initially has just two variables: `var1` and `var2`:
```{r}
dat1 <- data.frame(id   = 1:8,
                   var1 = c(2,1,2,5,7, 8, 9,5),
                   var2 = c(2,2,1,9,7, 4,25,3),
                   educ = c(3,1,2,2,1, 3, 2,-1),
                   gend = c(2,1,1,2,1,2,1,2),
                   x    = c(2,1,2,4,1,NA,NA,NA) )
dat1
```

Here is the translation of the provided text into English:

## Regression Models with `lm()` {#lm1}

```{r, echo = F}
m1 <- lm(var2 ~ var1, data = dat1)  
```

Regression models in R can be created with `lm()`. Here, we specify the variable for the y-axis (the *dependent* variable) and, after a `~`, the variable for the x-axis (the *independent* variable). We will discuss the interpretation of the results in the coming weeks.

```{r}
lm(var2 ~ var1, data = dat1)
```

The value under `var1` indicates *how much the line changes up/down per "step to the right"*. Thus, the line increases by `r m1$coefficients[2]` for each unit of `var1`. We can store the results under `m1`:
```{r}
m1 <- lm(var2 ~ var1, data = dat1)  
```

With `summary()`, we get a regression table:
```{r}
summary(m1)
```

`m1` contains all the information about the model, and `$coefficients` is particularly helpful:
```{r}
m1$coefficients
summary(m1)$coefficients
```

We can view the individual values with `View(m1)`:

```{r ols1_str, message=F, out.width="100%", out.height="10%"}
#| echo: false
listviewer::jsonedit(m1, mode="view") 
```

For example, `fitted.values` contains the predicted values for each case.


### [Exercise](#reg1) 

## Calculating Models for Specific Cases

If we want to recalculate the model, we have two options:

### Create a New Data Frame

We can keep multiple `data.frame` objects in memory in R. Thus, we can easily create a new `data.frame` containing only observations with `var2 < 20` and use this for our `lm()` command:

```{r ols2}
dat1_u20 <- dat1 %>% filter(var2 < 20)
m2a <- lm(var2 ~ var1, data = dat1_u20)
summary(m2a)
```

### Filter Directly in `lm()`

We can also incorporate the `filter()` command directly into the `data=` argument of `lm()`:

```{r ols2a}
m2b <- lm(var2 ~ var1, data = dat1 %>% filter(var2 < 20))
summary(m2b)
```

## Regression tables

If we want to compare these different models, a table is a good option.

There are numerous alternatives for creating regression tables, and my personal favorite is `modelsummary()` from the eponymous package [{modelsummary}](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/). It handles (almost) all types of models and offers a wide range of features, including [Word output](#14_tabellenexport.qmd) (more on this later) and coefficient plots (which we will also cover). Additionally, the [documentation](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/modelsummary.html) is excellent.

```{r}
#| eval: false
fdz_install("modelsummary")
```

```{r}
#| message: false
library(modelsummary)
modelsummary(list(m1,m2a,m2b))
```

We will delve a bit more into the customization options for `{modelsummary}` later, but here are two key options for now:

+ By using `stars = T`, we can display the significance levels with the common star codes (`*`: p < .05, etc.)
+ By using `gof_omit = "IC|RM|Log"`, we can hide the goodness of fit statistics that have `IC`, `RM`, or `Log` in their names (such as `AIC`, `BIC`, `RMSE`, and `LogLikelihood`)
+ By using `"Name" =` in `list()`, we can specify names:


```{r}
modelsummary(list("m1"=m1,"m2a"=m2a,"m2b"=m2b),stars = T,gof_omit = "IC|RM|Log")
```

The `output =` option allows us to export the modelsummary as `.docx`-file:

```{r}
modelsummary(list("m1"=m1,"m2a"=m2a,"m2b"=m2b),stars = T,gof_omit = "IC|RM|Log",output = "./results/Regression_table.docx")
```

### [Exercise](#reg2)

## Categorical Independent Variables

Of course, we can also include categorical independent variables in our model. However, we need to define the relevant variables as `factors` to inform R that the numeric values should not be interpreted numerically. 

For instance, in our small example, `educ` represents education levels where 1 stands for basic education, 2 for intermediate, and 3 for high education.

```{r}
dat1
m3 <- lm(var2 ~ factor(educ), dat1)
summary(m3)
```

It's even better if we label `educ` beforehand:

```{r}
dat1$ed_fct <- factor(dat1$educ, levels = 1:3,
                        labels = c("basic", "medium", "high"))
dat1
```

Then use the `factor` in the regression command:

```{r}
m3 <- lm(var2 ~ ed_fct, dat1)
summary(m3)
```

+ Compared to `educ = basic`, the predicted value for `var2` when `educ = medium` is `r round(m3$coefficients[2],2)` higher.

+ Compared to `educ = basic`, the predicted value for `var2` when `educ = high` is `r round(m3$coefficients[3],2)` higher.

We can also change the reference category:

```{r}
dat1$ed_fct <- relevel(dat1$ed_fct, ref = "medium")
m3b <- lm(var2 ~ ed_fct, dat1)
summary(m3b)
```

+ Compared to `educ = medium`, the predicted value for `var2` when `educ = basic` is `r round(abs(m3b$coefficients[2]),2)` lower.

+ Compared to `educ = medium`, the predicted value for `var2` when `educ = high` is `r round(abs(m3b$coefficients[3]),2)` lower.

### [Exercise](#reg3)

## Multiple Independent Variables

To include multiple independent variables in our regression models, we specify them using `+`:

```{r}
m4 <- lm(var2 ~ ed_fct + var1, dat1)
summary(m4)
```

## Coefficient Plots {#modelplot}

```{r}
#| include: false
theme_set(theme_grey(base_size = 15))  
```

In addition to regression tables, [`{modelsummary}`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/modelplot.html) provides the `modelplot()` function, which makes it easy to create coefficient plots from one or more models:

```{r}
#| out-width: "50%"
#| out-height: "50%"
modelplot(m4)
```

For model comparison, simply provide the models in a named `list`, and you can further customize the plot with the usual `{ggplot2}` commands:

```{r}
#| out-width: "50%"
#| out-height: "50%"
modelplot(list("Model 1" = m1,
               "Model 4" = m4))
```

With `coef_map`, you can assign labels to the coefficients (note that `(Intercept)` does not get a name and is therefore omitted):

```{r}
#| out-width: "50%"
#| out-height: "50%"
modelplot(list("Model 1" = m1,
               "Model 4" = m4),
          coef_map = c("var1" = "Name for var1",
                       "ed_fcthigh" = "Higher Education",
                       "ed_fctbasic" = "Basic Education"
                          ))
```

You can also further customize the plot with the usual `{ggplot2}` commands:

```{r}
#| out-width: "50%"
#| out-height: "50%"
modelplot(list("Model 1" = m1,
               "Model 4" = m4),
          coef_map = c("var1" = "Name for var1",
                       "ed_fcthigh" = "Higher Education",
                       "ed_fctbasic" = "Basic\nEducation")) + # \n inserts a line break
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 0), linetype = "dashed", color = "grey40") +  # Add a 0 line
  scale_color_manual(values = c("orange", "navy")) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15, base_family = "serif") 
```

With `{broom}`, you can also create a `data.frame` from the regression results and create the `ggplot` entirely yourself - [see appendix](#broomplt).

### margins: `{marginaleffects}` {.unnumbered}

Alternative visual summaries of regression results rely on marginal effects, contrasts, elasticities, or predictions. 
For all of these metric, see the [`{marginaleffects}`](https://marginaleffects.com/) package.

### [Exercise](#reg4)


## Exercises

Use the following subset of the PASS CampusFile:
```{r, echo = T, eval=FALSE}
pend_ue08 <- haven::read_dta("./orig/PENDDAT_cf_W13.dta") %>% 
  filter(welle == 13, netges > 0, azges1 > 0, schul2 > 1, palter > 0)
```

### Regression model {#reg1}

+ Create an object `mod1` with a linear regression model (`lm`) where `netges` (monthly net income in EUR) is the dependent variable and `azges1` (working hours) is the independent variable! (see [here](#lm1))
<!-- + Examine the results of `mod1` - what can you infer about the relationship between `netges` and `azges1`? -->
+ Create a regression table using `{modelsummary}` (remember to `fdz_install()` the package for first usage) and export it as a `docx` oder `tex` file!


### Categorical Independent Variables {#reg3}

+ Create a regression model with the income of respondents (`netges`) as the dependent variable and the education level of the respondents `schul` as the independent variable:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| classes: plain
library(gt)

  haven::read_dta("./orig/PENDDAT_cf_W13.dta",
                col_select = c("schul2"), n_max = 1) %>% 
  map_dfr(., ~attributes(.x)$labels, .id = "var") %>% 
  pivot_longer(-var) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = value, values_from = name) %>% 
  select(matches("^2|^3|^4|^5|^6|^7")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "value", values_to = "label") %>% 
  distinct()  %>% 
  mutate(value = glue::glue("`{value}`")) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_options(table.font.size = 14) %>% 
  cols_align(align = "left",columns = value) %>% 
  cols_width(value ~ px(80),
             value ~ px(40)) %>% 
  fmt_markdown(columns = value) 
```

+ Ensure that `schul2` is defined as a `factor`. Assign the labels "No degree", "Special education School", "Secondary School", "Intermediate Diploma", "Vocational School", "Abitur" to levels 2-7 and save the `factor` as a variable `schul2_fct` in your `data.frame` - see the code help below:
```{r}
#| eval: false
pend_ue08$schul2_fct <-  
  factor(pend_ue08$schul2, 
         levels = 2:7, 
         labels = c("No degree", "Special education School", "Secondary School",
                    "Intermediate secondary school", 
                    "Upper secondary", "Abitur"))
```
+ Create the regression model using this new factor variable for `schul2_fct` as the independent variable.
+ Change the reference category to *Intermediate secondary school* (`schul2` = 5) and estimate the model again.

### Multiple Independent Variables & Coefficient Plot {#reg4}

+ Adjust the `lm()` model `mod1` (with all cases from `pend_u08`) to include the education level (`schul2`) as an additional independent variable.
+ Also create a graphical comparison of the two models with and without the education level.

## Appendix


### Visualizing Regression Lines and Data

With `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`, we can also represent regression lines in `{ggplot2}`:

We can visualize our model with `var1` and `var2` as follows:

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=3, echo=T, fig.align="center", warning=F, message=F}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(dat1, aes(x = var1, y = var2)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")  
```

Here, it appears we have an outlier. In our small dataset, it is easy to find. In larger datasets, `geom_text()` can help us:
```{r graph2}
#| fig.height: 3
#| fig.width: 3
#| fig-align: center
#| warning: false
#| message: false
ggplot(dat1, aes(x = var1, y = var2)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")  +
  geom_text(data = . %>% filter(var2 > 20), aes(y = var2 + 3, label = id), color = "sienna1")
```

We can also specify `geom_` for just a subset by reassigning `data =` (not using the selection from the main `ggplot()` command) and applying a `filter()`. Additionally, we shift the label slightly above the point with `var2 + 3`.


```{r}
dat1 <- dat1 %>% select(-matches("compl"))
```

```{r}
#| include: false
theme_set(theme_x)
```

### Predicted Values {#pred}

The predicted values from `lm()` can be found under `$fitted.values`:
```{r}
m1$fitted.values
```
These predicted values are simply the sum of the value under `Intercept` and the value under `var1` multiplied by the respective value for `var1`. 
```{r}
m1
```
For the first row of `dat1`, the predicted value from `m1` is: `2.1351 + 0.5811 * 1 = ``r 2.1351 + 0.5811 * 1`

The values under `fitted.values` follow the order in the dataset, so we can simply add them as a new column in `dat1`:
```{r}
dat1$lm_predictions <- m1$fitted.values
dat1
```
The plot shows how predictions based on `m1` look: They correspond to the values on the blue line (the so-called regression line) at the respective points for `var1`. 
```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=3, echo=T, fig.align="center", warning=F, message=F}
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(dat1, aes(x = var1, y = var2)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +      
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "darkblue", se = FALSE, size = .65) +
  geom_point(aes(x = var1, y = lm_predictions), color = "dodgerblue3", size = 3) +
  expand_limits(x = c(0,8), y = c(0,8))
```

### Residuals {#res2}

The light blue points (i.e., the predictions from `m1`) are close to the actual points. However, even the light blue points do not perfectly overlap with the actual values. 
These deviations between the predicted and actual values are called residuals:
$$Residual = observed\, value \; - \; predicted\, value$$
$$\varepsilon_{\text{i}} = \text{y}_{i} - \hat{y}_{i}$$
We can calculate these manually as the difference between the actual and predicted value or simply call them using `m1$residuals`:
```{r}
m1$residuals
```
We can also store the residuals for `lm` in `dat1`: 
```{r}
dat1$lm_residuals <- m1$residuals
dat1
```

Here are the residuals for `lm` shown in light blue:
```{r, fig.height=2.75, fig.width=2.75, fig.align="center", eval = T, message=F}
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(dat1, aes(x = var1, y = var2)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "darkblue", se = FALSE, size = .65) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = var1, xend = var1, y = var2, yend = lm_predictions), color = "dodgerblue3", size = .65, linetype = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_point(aes(x = var1, y = lm_predictions), color = "dodgerblue3", size = 3) +
  expand_limits(x = c(0,8), y = c(0,8))
```

### Checking Assumptions
[Model Dashboard](https://easystats.github.io/easystats/reference/model_dashboard.html)

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("performance")
```

```{r reg02, fig.height=9}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(performance)

model_test <- check_model(m4)
plot(model_test)
```

### Test for Normal Distribution of Residuals

Graphical check: Q-Q plot
```{r}
#| eval: false
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(m1, which = 2)
```
```{r, echo = F, fig.align="center", out.width="60%", message=F, warning = F}
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(m3, which = 2, ncol = 1, nrow = 1) + theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

You can check the normality assumption with the Shapiro-Wilk test & `shapiro.test()`. This tests the null hypothesis $H_0$: "The residuals are normally distributed" against the alternative hypothesis $H_A$: "The residuals significantly deviate from normal distribution."
```{r}
shapiro.test(m1$residuals) 
```

### Test for Homoscedasticity

Homoscedasticity is present when the predicted values are approximately equally distant from the actual values (`m1\$fitted.values`) across the entire range of values. There is both a graphical method for checking this and a formal test. For the graphical check, the predicted values and the residuals are plotted as a scatterplot. The `autoplot()` function can be helpful here:

```{r, eval = F}
autoplot(m1, which = 1)
```
```{r, fig.align="center",out.height ="50%", echo=F}
autoplot(m1, which = 1, ncol = 1, nrow = 1)  + theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```
The associated test is the Breusch-Pagan test. This test evaluates the null hypothesis ($H_0$) of "homoscedasticity" against the alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) of "heteroscedasticity." The p-value indicates the probability with which we must reject the homoscedasticity assumption. In R, you can use `bptest` from the `lmtest` package for this:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("lmtest")
```
```{r, message = F}
library(lmtest)
bptest(m3)
```

### Test for Multicollinearity

```{r, eval= F}
install.packages("car")
```

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
# library(car)
pendx <- haven::read_dta("./orig/PENDDAT_cf_W13.dta",n_max = 300)  %>% filter(netges >0, palter >0 )
mox <- lm(netges ~ palter + azges1, data=pendx)
car::vif(mox)
```

- A common threshold for the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is 10. Values of VIF above 10 indicate a serious multicollinearity problem, and often measures are recommended starting from a stricter threshold of about 5.00. In this specific example, all independent variables are within acceptable limits according to both thresholds.
- If multicollinearity is present, there are several ways to address it: We can exclude one or more independent variables from the model. This is ultimately a substantive question and cannot be resolved with a standard recipe. Alternatively, we can combine the collinear independent variables into index variables. For example, we could create a common index, such as the average of the respective independent variables.

### Comparing Regression Models

With the `{performance}` package, we can also perform a comprehensive model comparison:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("performance")
```

```{r reg03}
library(performance)
compare_performance(m1, m4, metrics = c("R2", "R2_adj"))
```

### Individual Coefficient Plots with `{broom}` {#broomplt}

`modelplot()` offers a quick way to create coefficient plots, but I often use [`{broom}` ](https://broom.tidyverse.org/). Using `broom::tidy(..., conf.int = TRUE)`, we get a `data.frame` with the results of the regression model, which we can then process further in `{ggplot2}`—if the standard solution from [`modelplot()`](09_reg.qmd#modelplot) doesn't meet our needs or preferences:

```{r mod1_tidy}
#| out-width: "90%"
#| out-height: "50%"
#| fig-align: "center"
library(broom) ## already loaded as part of the tidyverse
tidy(m3, conf.int = TRUE)

tidy(m3, conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, "ed_fct", "Education: ")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = term, x = estimate)) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 0), linetype = "dashed", color = "navy") +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax  = conf.high), height = .1) + 
  geom_point(color = "orange", shape = 18, size = 7) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```
